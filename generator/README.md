## Introduction

### Problem Formulation

We are tasked with creating a code generator for a simplified C-like programming language. The code generator will take an Intermediate Representation (IR) of the program and produce assembly code for a hypothetical machine. The IR is generated by a parser that processes the source code of the language.

The code generator will be responsible for translating the IR into assembly code, ensuring that the generated code adheres to the conventions of the target machine architecture. The generated assembly code will be used to execute the program on a x86 architecture.

We will use a qemu virtual machine to run the generated assembly code. The qemu virtual machine will provide an environment for executing the assembly code, allowing us to test and validate our code generator.

### Motivation

We need the final step in the compilation process, translating the IR into assembly code. This step is crucial for executing the program on a target machine.

### Objectives

- Implement a code generator that translates an Intermediate Representation (IR) into assembly code.
- Ensure the generated assembly code is compatible with x86 architecture.

## Technologies

- Python: The code generator will be implemented in Python, leveraging its capabilities for string manipulation and file handling.
- QEMU: A virtual machine that will be used to run the generated assembly code.

## Theoretical Framework

### x86 Assembly Language

x86 assembly language is a low-level programming language that is closely related to the architecture of the x86 family of processors. It provides a set of instructions that can be used to perform operations such as arithmetic, logic, and control flow. The assembly code generated by our code generator will follow the conventions of x86 assembly language, ensuring compatibility with the target machine.

## Development

### Design Considerations

We can remember that this C based programming language is a simplified version of C, the limitations are:

- Only supports the 'int' type
- Functions don't accept parameters
- No loops for are defined
- No array or pointer support
- Our L1 tag is the main function, so it does not appear in the IR

The grammar of the language can be found in the `parser/README.md` file, which describes the syntax of the language. The semantic analyzer will use this grammar to validate the semantic correctness of the program.

### Implementation

The code generator will be implemented in Python, and it will read the Intermediate Representation (IR) generated by the parser. The IR will be processed to generate assembly code that adheres to the conventions of x86 architecture.
