# Compilers Subject

This is the repository for the Compilers subject. The objective is to develop a compiler from scratch, using concepts learned on the subject.

We are group 5, team 01.

## Tasks

Here are the links for each project README.md

- [Lexer](./lexer/README.md)
- [Parser](./parser/README.md)
- [Semantic Analyzer](./semanter/README.md)
- [Intermediate Code Generator](./intermediator/README.md)
- [Assembly Code Generator](./generator/README.md)

#### How to run

Once you have installed the required libraries and cloned the repository, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
$ python compiler.py <source_file> <output_file>
```

Where `<source_file>` is the path to the source file you want to compile and `<output_file>` is the path where you want to save the compiled output.

To make it clear, the command mentioned before will run the entire proccess to compile and execute the source code, it will also generate the executable file in the output once the assembly code is generated.

To execute the assembly code generated, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ nasm -f elf32 <assembly_file> -o <output_object_file>
$ ld -m elf_i386 <output_object_file>
$ ./<output_executable>
```

Where `<assembly_file>` is the path to the assembly file generated by the code generator, `<output_object_file>` is the path where you want to save the object file, and `<output_executable>` is the name of the executable file that will be created.

## Tests

You can run tests for all the elements running:
```bash
$ python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
